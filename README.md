## **✨ Features**

- **100 Levels of Frustration**  
  Each level starts with an arbitrary scramble and a random, confusing instruction. You’ll never solve it, but you’ll try anyway, won’t you?

- **Unhelpful Hints**  
  Instructions like "Rotate 90 degrees left" and "Pray to the Rubik’s gods." Get ready to be baffled.

- **Timed Agony**  
  After 5 minutes of mind-numbing confusion, the puzzle solves itself. Or does it? Who knows?

- **Sarcastic Feedback**  
  At the end of each level, you’ll be given snarky messages and empty encouragement like "Well done... not."

- **Final Revelation**  
  After 100 levels, you’ll be told the truth... but is there really an answer? Spoiler: *Nope*.
